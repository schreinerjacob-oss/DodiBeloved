# Dodi Design Guidelines

## The Total Privacy Promise
Dodi is built on one unbreakable promise: total privacy. Every design choice must reinforce that nothing ever leaves the two devices after pairing. No servers, no data collection, no leaks possible.

## Brand Identity

**Name**: "dodi" (lowercase in app UI, title-case "Dodi" on icon)  
**Meaning**: Hebrew for "my beloved"  
**Design Philosophy**: Warm, intimate, handwritten-love-note meets secret garden aesthetic

## Color Palette

- **Primary**: Soft sage green (#A7C9B0)
- **Background**: Warm cream (#F8F1E9)
- **Accent**: Gentle blush (#F4C2C2)
- **Highlight**: Subtle gold (#D4AF37) for special moments and accents

## Logo Concepts (Create 4 Mockups)

1. **Intertwining Vines**: Two organic vine tendrils weaving together to form a subtle heart shape
2. **Flame Curves**: Two mirrored flame/ember curves creating a heart shape where they meet
3. **Infinity Rings**: Two thin gold rings interlocking to form an infinity-heart symbol
4. **Hebrew Typography**: Elegant Hebrew דּוֹדִי (Dodi) with a delicate vine flourish as underline

## Visual Language

**Atmosphere**: Intimate, private sanctuary for two  
**Interactions**: Subtle glows and gentle animations when new content arrives  
**Notifications**: Soft chimes, warm haptic feedback  
**Privacy Indicators**: Gentle lock icons, encryption status with calming visuals

## Typography

- **Headings**: Soft, slightly rounded sans-serif suggesting warmth
- **Body**: Clean, highly readable for extended reading of love notes
- **Accent Text**: Consider handwritten-style font for special moments (Whispers, love letters)

### 5. Heart Space (Daily Rituals)

### 6. Love Letters Vault (detail)

### 7. Settings & Privacy
- Clear encryption status indicators

- Data management options presented warmly, not technically

## Animation Principles

- **Gentle & Intimate**: No jarring or aggressive animations
- **Purposeful Glows**: Soft radial gradients when new content arrives
- **Smooth Transitions**: Content fades, slides gently (300-500ms)
- **One-Tap Reactions**: Subtle scale + opacity pulse (800ms)
- **Loading States**: Soft breathing animation in sage green

## Layout Structure

- **Spacing**: Generous padding throughout (16-24px mobile, 24-32px desktop)
- **Navigation**: Bottom tab bar (mobile) with 4-5 key sections
- **Headers**: Minimal, clean with app name/section title
- **Content Areas**: Centered, max-width containers for reading comfort

## Privacy-First Design Considerations

- Always visible encryption indicator (subtle lock icon)
- No thumbnails/previews in system notifications
- Clear visual distinction between "saved to Dodi" vs "nowhere else"
- Biometric unlock option with gentle fingerprint/face icon
- Offline mode clearly communicated with warm, reassuring messaging

## Responsive Approach

- **Mobile-First**: Primary experience on phones
- **PWA Install Prompt**: Warm invitation after first pairing
- **Tablet**: Comfortable two-column layouts where appropriate
- **Desktop**: Centered layouts, never stretching full-width

## Micro-Interactions

- Haptic feedback on important actions (message sent, "thinking of you" tap)
- Gentle pulse when partner is typing
- Soft chime when partner comes online (only if both opted in)
- Confetti/sparkle effect on anniversaries (subtle, elegant)

## Images

No hero images needed. This is a functionality-focused intimate app. All visuals are user-generated content (photos, videos in memories) or iconography (Heart Space mood picker, logos, UI elements). Focus on creating a warm, cohesive interface using the color palette and gentle visual treatments.
