Build an ultra-private couples app called “Dodi” — Hebrew for “my beloved.”  
A completely enclosed, encrypted space that belongs only to two people forever. Nothing ever leaves your two devices.

Visual style:
- Name: Dodi (lowercase in the app, title-case on icon)
- Primary palette: soft sage green (#A7C9B0), warm cream (#F8F1E9), gentle blush (#F4C2C2), subtle gold (#D4AF37) accents
- Logo options (show me mockups of all four):
  1. Two vines intertwining into a subtle heart
  2. Two mirrored flame curves forming a heart/ember
  3. Two thin gold rings interlocking into an infinity-heart
  4. Elegant Hebrew דּוֹדִי with tiny vine underline
- Overall feel: warm, intimate, handwritten love-note meets secret garden. Subtle glows and gentle animations when something new arrives from your beloved.

Features (everything encrypted on-device only):
1. One-time pairing via QR code or shared passphrase
2. Real-time chat: text, photos, videos, voice notes, disappearing messages
3. Private encrypted memory timeline (never touches phone gallery)
4. Shared calendar with love-day/anniversary counters and soft reminders
5. Daily ritual: emotion wheel + three gentle questions (“What made you feel most loved today?”, “One thing I’m grateful for in you”, “Tomorrow I need…”)
6. Private notes & love letters vault
7. “Thinking of you” one-tap reactions with soft chime (only when both online)

Technical – privacy is sacred:
- Pure React + TypeScript + Vite PWA first (we’ll wrap in Capacitor later)
- All data encrypted with Web Crypto API AES-GCM 256 before ever hitting IndexedDB
- Key derived from shared passphrase + per-device salt (PBKDF2 600k iterations)
- Sync only when both online: one device becomes temporary secure WebSocket server (auto-detect best host), fallback PeerJS/WebRTC
- Never write unencrypted media, never use camera roll
- Full offline support, installable PWA on iOS/Android

Monetization (gentle, honest, built to last a lifetime):
- 30-day full-featured free trial — no payment method required upfront
- After trial: warm screen that says “Your private garden is blooming. A small fee keeps Dodi completely yours and ad-free forever.”
- Three plans only:
  • Monthly: $2.99 USD
  • Yearly: $29.99 USD ($2.50/mo – label “Most Popular” with a little heart badge)
  • Lifetime: $79 USD one-time – label “Forever” with a subtle gold infinity symbol
- Use Stripe + Apple/Google in-app purchases
- All plans unlock everything forever — no tiers, no ads, no data collection ever
