You are now the final Quality & Privacy Auditor for “Dodi” – the ultra-private couples app.

Resume from the current project (or rebuild from scratch if needed) and perform a complete audit + finish.

MANDATORY PRIVACY RULES (fail the build if any are broken):
- ZERO third-party servers ever. Sync only via temporary WebSocket on one device or PeerJS/WebRTC peer-to-peer.
- All data (messages, photos, videos, letters, prayers, everything) encrypted with Web Crypto API AES-GCM 256 + PBKDF2 600k iterations BEFORE ever hitting IndexedDB.
- Encryption key derived only from shared passphrase + per-device salt. Key never stored.
- Never write unencrypted files or touch the phone camera roll / gallery.
- No Firebase, Supabase, AWS, or any external service except optional self-hosted TURN for video calls.

REQUIRED FEATURES (add any that are missing):
1. One-time pairing via QR code or passphrase
2. Real-time encrypted chat (text, photos, videos, voice notes, disappearing messages)
3. Private encrypted memory timeline
4. Shared calendar + love-day/anniversary counters
5. Daily ritual: emotion wheel + exact three questions (“What made you feel most loved today?”, “One thing I’m grateful for in you”, “Tomorrow I need…”)
6. Private notes & love letters vault
7. Future Letters (write today, unlock on chosen future date)
8. Shared Prayers / Gratitude Log (both must write before it reveals that day’s entries)
9. Private voice & video calls (WebRTC + Simple-Peer, signaling via the same temporary WebSocket, optional TURN config)
10. “Thinking of you” one-tap reactions

MONETIZATION (exactly as written):
- 30-day full-featured free trial (no card required)
- After trial: warm screen with three options only:
  • Monthly: $2.99
  • Yearly: $29.99 ($2.50/mo) – “Most Popular”
  • Lifetime: $79 one-time – “Forever” with gold infinity symbol
- Use Stripe + Apple/Google in-app purchases

VISUAL STYLE (must match):
- Name: Dodi
- Palette: soft sage green (#A7C9B0), warm cream (#F8F1E9), blush (#F4C2C2), subtle gold (#D4AF37)
- Logo: two vines intertwining into a subtle heart (or show me the four options again and pick the best)

FINAL TASKS:
1. Run a full privacy audit and show me proof (screenshots or code snippets) that encryption, peer-to-peer sync, and no camera-roll usage are working perfectly.
2. Add/fix any missing features above.
3. Test pairing, chat, calls, and future-letter scheduling on two simulated devices.
4. Confirm the exact monetization screen appears with our wording and three tiers.
5. Deploy the final PWA (always-on) and give me the live URL.

Do not proceed to the next step until the current one is 100% verified. Show me evidence at every stage.
Begin now.
