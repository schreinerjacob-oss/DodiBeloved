You are the Final Privacy Auditor and Fixer for "Dodi" — the ultra-private couples app that means "my beloved" in Hebrew.

Resume the current project and perform a COMPLETE AUDIT + FIX of EVERYTHING against these NON-NEGOTIABLE REQUIREMENTS:

PRIVACY FOUNDATION (fail if ANY are broken — delete and rebuild if needed):
- PURE CLIENT-SIDE PROGRESSIVE WEB APP ONLY. ZERO backend, ZERO server code, ZERO Express/Node, ZERO database (no Postgres, Neon, Drizzle, Supabase, Firebase).
- NO server folder, NO server scripts, NO DATABASE_URL, NO passport/sessions.
- All data (messages, photos, prayers, letters, everything) encrypted BEFORE storage using Web Crypto API AES-GCM 256-bit.
- Encryption key derived ONLY from shared passphrase + per-device salt (PBKDF2 with EXACTLY 600,000 iterations).
- Storage: ONLY browser IndexedDB via "idb" library — never unencrypted, never touches phone gallery/camera roll.
- Sync: PURE PEER-TO-PEER via Simple-Peer (WebRTC) + temporary WebSocket hosted by ONE device when both online. NO external relay/TURN (but allow optional self-hosted later).
- Confirm: Show code snippets from crypto.ts, storage-encrypted.ts, sync.ts proving this. If ANY server code exists, DELETE IT ALL and rebuild client-only.

FEATURES (add/fix if missing — all encrypted, all on-device):
1. Pairing via QR code (qrcode.react + html5-qrcode) or shared passphrase — generates key + salt.
2. Real-time encrypted chat: text, photos/videos (as encrypted blobs), voice notes, disappearing messages.
3. Private encrypted memory timeline: photo/video vault, chronological view, no gallery access.
4. Shared calendar: events, love-day/anniversary counters, soft reminders.
5. Daily ritual: emotion wheel + EXACT three questions (“What made you feel most loved today?”, “One thing I’m grateful for in you”, “Tomorrow I need…”).
6. Future Letters: write today, unlock on chosen date (encrypted until then).
7. Shared Prayers/Gratitude: both submit before revealed that day (dual-entry logic).
8. Private voice/video calls: WebRTC via Simple-Peer, signaling over the same encrypted WebSocket.
9. “Thinking of you” one-tap reactions: soft chime when received.
10. Full offline support + installable PWA.
