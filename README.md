# Dodi

*My beloved* — a private garden for the two of you.

## Vision

Dodi is a place for couples to connect without an audience. Think of it as your own **private garden**: just you and your person, with no one else in the middle. Everything you share stays between the two of you.

## Privacy promise

- **No servers in the middle.** Your messages and media go directly between your devices (peer-to-peer when possible).
- **On-device encryption.** Your data is encrypted on your phone or browser; we don’t hold your keys or read your content.
- **Your sanctuary, your rules.** Pair once, and your conversation stays in your hands.

## Features

- **Chat** — Send messages, photos, voice notes, and more. All encrypted and delivered directly when you’re both online.
- **Memories** — A shared photo gallery that lives only on your devices.
- **Calls** — Voice and video calls that stay between the two of you.

Plus: moments and anniversaries, a shared “heart space,” optional PIN lock, and a focus on staying private and simple.

## Setup

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open the URL shown in the terminal (e.g. `http://localhost:5000`) in your browser. Pair with your partner by scanning a QR code or entering a code from the other device.

## Beta

Dodi is currently in **beta**. We’re improving stability, performance, and polish. If you run into issues or have ideas, your feedback is welcome.
